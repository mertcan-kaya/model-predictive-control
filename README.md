![compare-DMC-designs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de03256e-082d-47c7-95bd-508519427a25)

d_m (k)=0, d(k)=0.5, v(k)=0 and Np = 20, Nu = 3

![2a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16785ecd-5654-4e3e-8ac5-93694a4bea10)

d_m (k)=0.8, d(k)=0, v(k)=0 and Np = 20, Nu = 3

![2b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/613063d0-6759-44c1-a827-ba0c4fef90b9)

d_m (k)=0, d(k)=1/((z-1)(z-0.6)) Δw, Δw(k) and v(k) are independent zero mean white noise signals and Np = 20, Nu = 3
